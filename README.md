Personal Goals
==============

Personal goals made open source. Transparency, accountability, and versioning!

*Note: for a while there I used the Daily [Three Things List here](https://github.com/jwithington/personal-goals/blob/master/content-list/three.md) more than the main list!*

## And here's why (08/05/2016)

I seem to have stagnated on this project once I had, yknow, a jobby job.

However, I really like doing it and I'm not ready to give it up just yet. I also finally got git and such set up on my Windows machine at work (that's how I'm typing this right now!), so I think it might be time to get it rolling again.

I do hope so. Stay tuned!
