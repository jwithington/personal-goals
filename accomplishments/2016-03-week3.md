### Week in Review

This is a review of two weeks, in fact. Rather than being bummed about that, I think it reflects a strong dedication to getting things done; and yet, I want to recommit to using this this week.

These weeks were super important. I was able to find a good rhythm (Skillcrush course, then do some other work, lunch, and try and schedule Tot and house stuff in the afternoon), and I accomplished a ton using the Threes list. I also had some super fun days with Erin; I think this has to do with a re-dedication to simply trying to make the house a bit better every day. Almost every threes list had a house thing in the top three; that's intentional.

At the same time, I see how missing a week really made the goals seem stale and my reflection seem a bit broad. Time to do it differently this week! I also feel like I'm working hard on removing myself from commitments. That's been super positive.
