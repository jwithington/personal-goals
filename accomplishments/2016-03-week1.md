### Week in Review

Sort of a big week in my world due to the rent thing and the shift in focus.  This week I thought more about how to schedule things, what needed to be dropped from my world, and how to include it all and be a good boyfriend ‚Äî so I think the theme went well! I had a couple of days where I was enormously productive, but I also need to shift my concept of what is a positive/negative day when I'm working on things that I might try to complete, but maybe won't complete in one day. I worked on asking for help, and recommitted to Mentorship Saturdays.
